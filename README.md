[CMPINF 0401 - In-class Exercise]

# CarRace
**Goal:** Implement a simple command-line-based car race game where two drivers compete
- A driver can sign up for a car race
- A driver has a car
- A car has at least a model (*Note: this template is simplified, see I06/I07*)
- A car also has a speed, that should increase when it drives and when the car accelerates
- To add some fun, acceleration is determined by a random number, while a maximum speed is maintained

# Learning Goals
- Work with multiple classes & objects
- Construct objects that contain references to other objects
- Understand null checks

# Tasks
- Take a look at the diagram from L09
- This code template already contains the corresponding **method stubs** but is missing the concrete implementation as well as some attributes

Your task is to complete the code.
